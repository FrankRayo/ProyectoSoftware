      </h1>
      <p>Hello There,</p>
      <p>Before we get started the team would like to wish everyone a very happy new year!</p>
      <p>With the new year, we have decided to take a new direction for the game so we have introduced a few changes to alpha testing and our roadmap. Let's jump into it!</p>
      
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>ALPHA TESTING ACCESS</h2>
      <p>As of this year, accessing the closed alpha will be restricted to application only. The sign up information is available on the homepage of the cwaemu website! Now you might be wondering, why did we choose to go with this method? Here is why:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First of all, going by this method, people who aren't on the discord can get access to the builds!</li>
        <li>Secondly, with people applying, we can now bring in more testers at a time, without having to host an event, so that we can stress test the servers.</li>
        <li>Thirdly, it gives us the ability to test the game for individual platforms!</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>ROADMAP CHANGES</h2>
      <p>We have decided to expand the roadmap, moving up housing to be our next big objective, following social abilities and quality of life.</p>
      <p>We've also decided to let the community choose what minigames we should focus on, the roadmap showcasing two different minigames milestones, which once hovered over would reveal three spots, marked as 'TBA: COMMUNITY VOTE', so stay tuned for that, coming soonâ„¢!</p>
      
      <p>Thank you for following the development of Clone Wars Adventures Emulator, we wish you a very happy 2021, and we are looking forward to seeing you in-game!</p>
